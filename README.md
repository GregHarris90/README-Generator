# Technology-Used

- For this project I used Node.js to create an index.js file and then installed npm with the Inquirer dependency to help build this application.

# User-Story

- After installing the necessary documents the user can open the integrated terminal and begin the process of creating a README.md file entering 'node index.js.'

- Then the user is given a series of prompts asking questions to obtain information/details about the project being built.

- After answering all questions the user will see "Successfully wrote to README.md" and find their generated README in the file system under the relevant folder.

# Conclusion

- Overall this homework assignment went relatively well, as this module on Node.js seems to be pretty straightforward. I ran into a couple challenges with getting the license badge to appear properly and making this section appear how I wanted it to in the final README. As well as trying to record a demo video and attach it to my final repository.
